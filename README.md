# OLA_Ride_Cancelation_Analysis
<h3>What is the Project About?</h3>
<p>This project analyzes ride cancellation patterns in Ola to understand the key reasons behind cancellations and their impact on customer experience. The Goal is to :</p>
<li>Identify cancellation trends and patterns.</li>
<li>Find root causes behind failed rides.</li>
<li>Predict cancellations using machine learning.</li>
<li>Deliver insights using SQL views and Power BI dashboards.</li>

<h3>Why This Project?</h3>
<p>Cancellations not only frustrate customers but also result in:</p>
<li>Revenue loss</li>
<li>Lower customer satisfaction</li>
<li>Operational inefficiency</li>

<p>Understanding "why and when" rides are cancelled allows the business to:</p>
<li>Improve driver allocation</li>
<li>Reduce avoidable cancellations</li>
<li>Increase ride completion rates</li>

<h3>Dataset Details</h3>
<p>The dataset includes the following key attributes:</p>

<li>Ride Details: Ride ID, Customer ID, Driver ID, Pickup & Drop Locations.</li>
<li>Cancellation Information: Reason for Cancellation, Who Canceled (Driver/Customer).</li>
<li>Booking Details: Time of Booking, Estimated vs. Actual Pickup Time.</li>
<li>Customer & Driver Metrics: Customer Ride History, Driver Cancellation Rate.</li>

<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
<li>Handled missing and inconsistent data using SQL.</li>
<li>Standardized cancellation reasons for better categorization.</li>
<li>Removed duplicate entries and irrelevant data points.</li>
<li>Analyzed booking timestamps to detect peak cancellation hours</li>

<h3>Key Insights</h3>
<li>Identified primary reasons for ride cancellations (e.g., driver cancellations, pricing issues, long wait times).</li>
<li>Determined high-risk time slots and locations where cancellations are frequent.</li>
<li>Analyzed customer behavior patterns and impact on retention.</li>
<li>Assessed driver-side factors contributing to ride cancellations.</li>

<h3>Visualizations</h3>
<li>Created Power BI dashboards</li>
<li>Used bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps</li>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<li>SQL: Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.</li>
<li>Excel: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and initial visualization.</li>
<li>Power BI: Interactive dashboards and in-depth visualizations.</li>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This analysis provides actionable insights into Olaâ€™s ride cancellation patterns. By addressing key issues such as driver availability, pricing concerns, and long wait times, Ola can enhance customer satisfaction and reduce cancellation rates.</p>
