# OLA_Ride_Cancelation_Analysis
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>Ride cancellations can negatively impact customer satisfaction and driver efficiency. This project analyzes OLA ride data to:</p>
<li>Identify key trends in ride cancellations.</li>
<li>Pinpoint the primary reasons for ride cancellations.</li>
<li>Suggest data-driven solutions to reduce cancellations and enhance the customer experience.</li>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<li>SQL: Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.</li>
<li>Excel: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and initial visualization.</li>
<li>Power BI: Interactive dashboards and in-depth visualizations.</li>

<h3>Key Trends in Ride Cancellations</h3>
<h4>Cancellation Rates</h4>
<li>~20% of cancellations are initiated by drivers, while ~10% are customer-initiated.</li>
<li>Cancellations are more frequent during peak hours and weekends, likely due to high demand or driver unavailability.</li>
<h4>Location-Based Impact</h4>

<li>Certain locations experience higher cancellation rates, possibly due to traffic congestion or longer distances.</li>
<h4>Vehicle Type Correlation</h4>

<li>Budget vehicles have higher cancellation rates compared to premium vehicles, indicating potential fare-related issues or driver preferences.</li>
<h4>Payment Method Preferences</h4>

<li>A higher rate of cancellations is observed for cash payment bookings, as drivers may prefer digital payments.</li>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The analysis highlighted that ride cancellations are driven by low fares, long wait times, and inconvenient locations. Drivers often cancel due to unprofitable rides, while customers cancel due to delays or sudden changes in plans.

To reduce cancellations, OLA can implement dynamic pricing, optimize ride allocation, incentivize digital payments, and improve communication. These strategies will enhance customer satisfaction, reduce disruptions, and ensure smoother operations.</p>
